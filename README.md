Project: *You're such a card!*

Goal: Develop a fifty-six-card deck of cards using HTML, CSS, CSS Flex-box and JavaScript.  Make a front and
back for each card.  Allow a whole deck to be generated and shuffled for use in a card game.  Use a 3-D flip animation
to transition from viewing the back of the card to viewing the front.  

Extra features:

2 - Allow for multiple decks to used in a game
